    ├── When setting new trade limits
    │   ├── It should update {maxBuyAmount}, {maxSellAmount}, and {maxWalletAmount}.

    │   └── It should emit a {TradeLimitsUpdated} event.
    │       └── Because logs should track trade limit changes.
    └── When setting trade limits to zero
        ├── It should update {maxBuyAmount}, {maxSellAmount}, and {maxWalletAmount} to zero.
        │   └── Because zero limits effectively disable trading limits.
